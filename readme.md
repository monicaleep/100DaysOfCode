  - Also, first time to run microservices.
- Day 4: Add my own search feature to the ToDo app all by myself :)
- Day 5: Reviewed Sass on freeCodeCamp and worked through React (official tutorial) and started [React](react.md) section on freeCodeCamp.
- Day 6: Working through [React](react.md) section on freeCodeCamp - 50% done. Finding this a bit better to understand than the "official" React tutorial.
